# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction----Kaggle

## Workshop 1 — Systems Analysis & Design  
### Forest Cover Type Prediction (Kaggle Competition)  

---

## Introduction  
This repository was created as part of **Workshop 1** for the *Systems Analysis & Design* course.  
Our group selected the Kaggle competition **[Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction)**, which is a supervised classification challenge. The objective is to predict the **forest cover type** (7 possible classes) from cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, and proximity to hydrology, roads, and fire points.  

The purpose of this project is not only to explore the dataset, but also to apply **systems thinking** and **engineering analysis**. We analyze the system’s complexity, sensitivity to variables, and possible non-linear or chaotic behaviors, connecting machine learning challenges with systemic perspectives.

## Overview  
This repository contains the deliverables for **Workshop 1** of the *Systems Analysis & Design* course.  
The selected competition is [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction), a supervised classification problem where the task is to predict the type of forest cover (7 categories) based on cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, and distance to hydrology, roads, and fire points.  

The workshop focuses on applying **systems thinking** and **engineering analysis** to understand the dataset, relationships, complexity, sensitivity, and potential chaotic behaviors within the system.

## Methodology  
The analysis was conducted in the following steps:  

1. **Competition Overview**  
   - Reviewed the Kaggle competition description.  
   - Identified the dataset structure, number of variables, and prediction target.  

2. **Systemic Analysis**  
   - Mapped the system’s **key elements** (inputs, processes, outputs, constraints).  
   - Built relationship diagrams to visualize **data flows** and system boundaries.  

3. **Complexity & Sensitivity**  
   - Analyzed how changes in input parameters (e.g., elevation, soil type, slope) affect the outcome.  
   - Highlighted potential sources of variability and conflicts in the system.  

4. **Chaos and Randomness**  
   - Discussed possible non-linearities, feedback loops, and unpredictable behaviors in the dataset and modeling process.  

5. **Conclusions**  
   - Summarized the main findings, emphasizing system strengths (large dataset, diversity of variables) and weaknesses (high dimensionality, correlation between variables).

## Repository Updates  
This repository will continue to evolve as the course progresses.  
- Each **workshop** will have its own folder and deliverables.  
- The **README.md** will be updated to reflect new analyses and outcomes.  
- The **commit history** will serve as a record of how the project has advanced over time.
