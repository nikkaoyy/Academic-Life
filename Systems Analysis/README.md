# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction----Kaggle

## Workshop 1 — Systems Analysis & Design  
### Forest Cover Type Prediction (Kaggle Competition)  

## Overview  
This repository contains the deliverables for **Workshop 1** of the *Systems Analysis & Design* course.  
The selected competition is [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction), a supervised classification problem where the task is to predict the type of forest cover (7 categories) based on cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, and distance to hydrology, roads, and fire points.  

The workshop focuses on applying **systems thinking** and **engineering analysis** to understand the dataset, relationships, complexity, sensitivity, and potential chaotic behaviors within the system.

## Methodology  
The analysis was conducted in the following steps:  

1. **Competition Overview**  
   - Reviewed the Kaggle competition description.  
   - Identified the dataset structure, number of variables, and prediction target.  

2. **Systemic Analysis**  
   - Mapped the system’s **key elements** (inputs, processes, outputs, constraints).  
   - Built relationship diagrams to visualize **data flows** and system boundaries.  

3. **Complexity & Sensitivity**  
   - Analyzed how changes in input parameters (e.g., elevation, soil type, slope) affect the outcome.  
   - Highlighted potential sources of variability and conflicts in the system.  

4. **Chaos and Randomness**  
   - Discussed possible non-linearities, feedback loops, and unpredictable behaviors in the dataset and modeling process.  

5. **Conclusions**  
   - Summarized the main findings, emphasizing system strengths (large dataset, diversity of variables) and weaknesses (high dimensionality, correlation between variables).

## Deliverables  
- **Report (PDF):** Detailed systems analysis of the competition.  
- **Diagrams:** Visual representations of system architecture, element relationships, and data flow.  
- **GitHub Repository:** Centralized storage of all documents, code, and diagrams.

## Repository Updates  
This repository will continue to evolve as the course progresses.  
- Each **workshop** will have its own folder and deliverables.  
- The **README.md** will be updated to reflect new analyses and outcomes.  
- The **commit history** will serve as a record of how the project has advanced over time.

## Deadline  
All deliverables for **Workshop 1** were submitted by **Saturday, September 27th, 2025 at 8:00 AM**, according to course policy.
