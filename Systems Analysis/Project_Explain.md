# ðŸŒ² Forest Cover Type Prediction â€” Kaggle Competition  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository is dedicated to the Kaggle competition **[Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction)**.  
The challenge is a **supervised multiclass classification problem** where the task is to predict the **forest cover type** (7 possible classes) from cartographic variables such as:  
- Elevation  
- Slope and aspect  
- Soil type  
- Distance to hydrology, roads, and fire points  

The goal of this repository is not only to build predictive models, but also to explore the dataset from different perspectives â€” including **exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning approaches, and systems thinking** to understand complexity and interactions within the data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand distributions and correlations.  
- Apply **machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).  
- Evaluate models using **accuracy and confusion matrices**.  
- Explore **systemic properties**: sensitivity, complexity, and variable interactions.  
- Document the workflow and findings for both academic and practical purposes.
