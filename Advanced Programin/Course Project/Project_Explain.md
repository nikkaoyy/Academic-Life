# Advanced Programming Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of my **Advanced Programming** course project.  
This work aims to leverage modern programming paradigms, design principles, and problem-solving strategies to develop efficient and well-structured software solutions for the medical sector, specifically addressing the slow pace of medication delivery within EPS systems to expedite access for patients in need.

The project demonstrates skills in:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Design Patterns
- Clean Code practices
- Software Documentation and Version Control
